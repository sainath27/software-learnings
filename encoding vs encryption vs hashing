Encoding :
the process of converting data or informatin from one form to other another. this can involve chanding the format, structure, or represenation of the data to make it compatible with a specific system or for transmisson, or storage, or processing purposes.

Ex: text can encoded into binary for computer processing, or audio can be encoded into mp3 format for storage and playback.

Conversion vs Encoding: Encoding specifically involves chanding the representation of data, often for storage, transmission, or processing.



Hashing/Hashing algorithms: 
Def: Math formula that transform messages or data into deterministic, fixed-length representational strings.

Hashes are primarily used for verification and integrity checks rather than encryption and decryption.
